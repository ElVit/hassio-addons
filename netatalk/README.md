## About

A simple Add-on which sets up a Netatalk server.  
It allows you to share files in your local network over the AFP protocol.  

The special about this addon is that it exposes the config file so you can adapt it to your needs.    
That means your are able to define multiple users and share only specific directories for specific users.  

This addon is for advanced users and requires knowledge of how to write an afp.conf file.
